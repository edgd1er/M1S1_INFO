<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction</h2>

<p>Vmgen is a tool for writing efficient interpreters.  It takes a simple
virtual machine description and generates efficient C code for dealing
with the virtual machine code in various ways (in particular, executing
it).  The run-time efficiency of the resulting interpreters is usually
within a factor of 10 of machine code produced by an optimizing
compiler.

   <p>The interpreter design strategy supported by Vmgen is to divide the
interpreter into two parts:

     <ul>
<li>The <em>front end</em> takes the source code of the language to be
implemented, and translates it into virtual machine code.  This is
similar to an ordinary compiler front end; typically an interpreter
front-end performs no optimization, so it is relatively simple to
implement and runs fast.

     <li>The <em>virtual machine interpreter</em> executes the virtual
machine code.

   </ul>

   <p>Such a division is usually used in interpreters, for modularity as well
as for efficiency.  The virtual machine code is typically passed between
front end and virtual machine interpreter in memory, like in a
load-and-go compiler; this avoids the complexity and time cost of
writing the code to a file and reading it again.

   <p>A <em>virtual machine</em> (VM) represents the program as a sequence of
<em>VM instructions</em>, following each other in memory, similar to real
machine code.  Control flow occurs through VM branch instructions, like
in a real machine.

   <p><a name="index-functionality-features-overview-1"></a>In this setup, Vmgen can generate most of the code dealing with virtual
machine instructions from a simple description of the virtual machine
instructions (see <a href="Input-File-Format.html#Input-File-Format">Input File Format</a>), in particular:

     <dl>
<dt><strong>VM instruction execution</strong>
<br><dt><strong>VM code generation</strong><dd>Useful in the front end.

     <br><dt><strong>VM code decompiler</strong><dd>Useful for debugging the front end.

     <br><dt><strong>VM code tracing</strong><dd>Useful for debugging the front end and the VM interpreter.  You will
typically provide other means for debugging the user's programs at the
source level.

     <br><dt><strong>VM code profiling</strong><dd>Useful for optimizing the VM interpreter with superinstructions
(see <a href="VM-profiler.html#VM-profiler">VM profiler</a>).

   </dl>

   <p>To create parts of the interpretive system that do not deal with VM
instructions, you have to use other tools (e.g., <samp><span class="command">bison</span></samp>) and/or
hand-code them.

   <p><a name="index-efficiency-features-overview-2"></a>Vmgen supports efficient interpreters though various optimizations, in
particular

     <ul>
<li>Threaded code

     <li>Caching the top-of-stack in a register

     <li>Combining VM instructions into superinstructions

     <li>Replicating VM (super)instructions for better BTB prediction accuracy
(not yet in vmgen-ex, but already in Gforth).

   </ul>

   <p><a name="index-speed-for-JVM-3"></a>As a result, Vmgen-based interpreters are only about an order of
magnitude slower than native code from an optimizing C compiler on small
benchmarks; on large benchmarks, which spend more time in the run-time
system, the slowdown is often less (e.g., the slowdown of a
Vmgen-generated JVM interpreter over the best JVM JIT compiler we
measured is only a factor of 2-3 for large benchmarks; some other JITs
and all other interpreters we looked at were slower than our
interpreter).

   <p>VMs are usually designed as stack machines (passing data between VM
instructions on a stack), and Vmgen supports such designs especially
well; however, you can also use Vmgen for implementing a register VM
(see <a href="Register-Machines.html#Register-Machines">Register Machines</a>) and still benefit from most of the advantages
offered by Vmgen.

   <p>There are many potential uses of the instruction descriptions that are
not implemented at the moment, but we are open for feature requests, and
we will consider new features if someone asks for them; so the feature
list above is not exhaustive.
