<h2 class="chapter">10 The future</h2>

<p><a name="index-future-ideas-200"></a>
We have a number of ideas for future versions of Vmgen.  However, there
are so many possible things to do that we would like some feedback from
you.  What are you doing with Vmgen, what features are you missing, and
why?

   <p>One idea we are thinking about is to generate just one <samp><span class="file">.c</span></samp> file
instead of letting you copy and adapt all the wrapper files (you would
still have to define stuff like the type-specific macros, and stack
pointers etc. somewhere).  The advantage would be that, if we change the
wrapper files between versions, you would not need to integrate your
changes and our changes to them; Vmgen would also be easier to use for
beginners.  The main disadvantage of that is that it would reduce the
flexibility of Vmgen a little (well, those who like flexibility could
still patch the resulting <samp><span class="file">.c</span></samp> file, like they are now doing for
the wrapper files).  In any case, if you are doing things to the wrapper
files that would cause problems in a generated-<samp><span class="file">.c</span></samp>-file approach,
please let us know.
