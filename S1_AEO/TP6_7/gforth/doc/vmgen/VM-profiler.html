<h3 class="section">8.6 VM profiler</h3>

<p><a name="index-VM-profiler-189"></a><a name="index-profiling-for-selecting-superinstructions-190"></a><a name="index-superinstructions-and-profiling-191"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007bprofile_002ec_007d-192"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007b_002dprofile_002ei_007d-output-file-193"></a>
The VM profiler is designed for getting execution and occurence counts
for VM instruction sequences, and these counts can then be used for
selecting sequences as superinstructions.  The VM profiler is probably
not useful as profiling tool for the interpretive system.  I.e., the VM
profiler is useful for the developers, but not the users of the
interpretive system.

   <p>The output of the profiler is: for each basic block (executed at least
once), it produces the dynamic execution count of that basic block and
all its subsequences; e.g.,

<pre class="example">            9227465  lit storelocal
            9227465  storelocal branch
            9227465  lit storelocal branch
</pre>
   <p>I.e., a basic block consisting of `<samp><span class="samp">lit storelocal branch</span></samp>' is
executed 9227465 times.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007bstat_002eawk_007d-194"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007bseq2rule_002eawk_007d-195"></a>This output can be combined in various ways.  E.g.,
<samp><span class="file">vmgen-ex/stat.awk</span></samp> adds up the occurences of a given sequence wrt
dynamic execution, static occurence, and per-program occurence.  E.g.,

<pre class="example">           2      16        36910041 loadlocal lit
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">indicates that the sequence `<samp><span class="samp">loadlocal lit</span></samp>' occurs in 2 programs,
in 16 places, and has been executed 36910041 times.  Now you can select
superinstructions in any way you like (note that compile time and space
typically limit the number of superinstructions to 100&ndash;1000).  After
you have done that, <samp><span class="file">vmgen/seq2rule.awk</span></samp> turns lines of the form
above into rules for inclusion in a Vmgen input file.  Note that this
script does not ensure that all prefixes are defined, so you have to do
that in other ways.  So, an overall script for turning profiles into
superinstructions can look like this:

<pre class="example">     awk -f stat.awk fib.prof test.prof|
     awk '$3&gt;=10000'|                #select sequences
     fgrep -v -f peephole-blacklist| #eliminate wrong instructions
     awk -f seq2rule.awk|            #turn into superinstructions
     sort -k 3 &gt;mini-super.vmg       #sort sequences
</pre>
   <p>Here the dynamic count is used for selecting sequences (preliminary
results indicate that the static count gives better results, though);
the third line eliminates sequences containing instructions that must not
occur in a superinstruction, because they access a stack directly.  The
dynamic count selection ensures that all subsequences (including
prefixes) of longer sequences occur (because subsequences have at least
the same count as the longer sequences); the sort in the last line
ensures that longer superinstructions occur after their prefixes.

   <p>But before using this, you have to have the profiler.  Vmgen supports its
creation by generating <samp><var>file</var><span class="file">-profile.i</span></samp>; you also need the
wrapper file <samp><span class="file">vmgen-ex/profile.c</span></samp> that you can use almost verbatim.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bSUPER_005fEND_007d-in-profiling-196"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bBB_005fBOUNDARY_007d-in-profiling-197"></a>The profiler works by recording the targets of all VM control flow
changes (through <code>SUPER_END</code> during execution, and through
<code>BB_BOUNDARY</code> in the front end), and counting (through
<code>SUPER_END</code>) how often they were targeted.  After the program run,
the numbers are corrected such that each VM basic block has the correct
count (entering a block without executing a branch does not increase the
count, and the correction fixes that), then the subsequences of all
basic blocks are printed.  To get all this, you just have to define
<code>SUPER_END</code> (and <code>BB_BOUNDARY</code>) appropriately, and call
<code>vm_print_profile(FILE *file)</code> when you want to output the profile
on <code>file</code>.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bVM_005fIS_005fINST_007d-in-profiling-198"></a>The <samp><var>file</var><span class="file">-profile.i</span></samp> is similar to the disassembler file, and
it uses variables and functions defined in <samp><span class="file">vmgen-ex/profile.c</span></samp>,
plus <code>VM_IS_INST</code> already defined for the VM disassembler
(see <a href="VM-disassembler.html#VM-disassembler">VM disassembler</a>).
