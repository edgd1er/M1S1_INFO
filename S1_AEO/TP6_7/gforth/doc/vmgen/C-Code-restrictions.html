<h4 class="subsection">6.2.3 C Code restrictions</h4>

<p><a name="index-C-code-restrictions-91"></a><a name="index-restrictions-on-C-code-92"></a><a name="index-assumptions-about-C-code-93"></a>
<a name="index-accessing-stack-_0028pointer_0029-94"></a><a name="index-stack-pointer_002c-access-95"></a><a name="index-instruction-pointer_002c-access-96"></a>Vmgen generates code and performs some optimizations under the
assumption that the user-supplied C code does not access the stack
pointers or stack items, and that accesses to the instruction pointer
only occur through special macros.  In general you should heed these
restrictions.  However, if you need to break these restrictions, read
the following.

   <p>Accessing a stack or stack pointer directly can be a problem for several
reasons:
<a name="index-stack-caching_002c-restriction-on-C-code-97"></a><a name="index-superinstructions_002c-restrictions-on-components-98"></a>
     <ul>
<li>Vmgen optionally supports caching the top-of-stack item in a local
variable (that is allocated to a register).  This is the most frequent
source of trouble.  You can deal with it either by not using
top-of-stack caching (slowdown factor 1-1.4, depending on machine), or
by inserting flushing code (e.g., `<samp><span class="samp">IF_spTOS(sp[...] = spTOS);</span></samp>') at
the start and reloading code (e.g., `<samp><span class="samp">IF_spTOS(spTOS = sp[0])</span></samp>') at
the end of problematic C code.  Vmgen inserts a stack pointer update
before the start of the user-supplied C code, so the flushing code has
to use an index that corrects for that.  In the future, this flushing
may be done automatically by mentioning a special string in the C code. 
<!-- sometimes flushing and/or reloading unnecessary -->

     <li>The Vmgen-erated code loads the stack items from stack-pointer-indexed
memory into variables before the user-supplied C code, and stores them
from variables to stack-pointer-indexed memory afterwards.  If you do
any writes to the stack through its stack pointer in your C code, it
will not affect the variables, and your write may be overwritten by the
stores after the C code.  Similarly, a read from a stack using a stack
pointer will not reflect computations of stack items in the same VM
instruction.

     <li>Superinstructions keep stack items in variables across the whole
superinstruction.  So you should not include VM instructions, that
access a stack or stack pointer, as components of superinstructions
(see <a href="VM-profiler.html#VM-profiler">VM profiler</a>).

   </ul>

   <p>You should access the instruction pointer only through its special
macros (`<samp><span class="samp">IP</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">SET_IP</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">IPTOS</span></samp>'); this ensure that these
macros can be implemented in several ways for best performance. 
`<samp><span class="samp">IP</span></samp>' points to the next instruction, and `<samp><span class="samp">IPTOS</span></samp>' is its
contents.
