<h3 class="section">9.1 Floating point</h3>

<p>How should you deal with floating point values?  Should you use the same
stack as for integers/pointers, or a different one?  This section
discusses this issue with a view on execution speed.

   <p>The simpler approach is to use a separate floating-point stack.  This
allows you to choose FP value size without considering the size of the
integers/pointers, and you avoid a number of performance problems.  The
main downside is that this needs an FP stack pointer (and that may not
fit in the register file on the 386 arhitecture, costing some
performance, but comparatively little if you take the other option into
account).  If you use a separate FP stack (with stack pointer <code>fp</code>),
using an fpTOS is helpful on most machines, but some spill the fpTOS
register into memory, and fpTOS should not be used there.

   <p>The other approach is to share one stack (pointed to by, say, <code>sp</code>)
between integer/pointer and floating-point values.  This is ok if you do
not use <code>spTOS</code>.  If you do use <code>spTOS</code>, the compiler has to
decide whether to put that variable into an integer or a floating point
register, and the other type of operation becomes quite expensive on
most machines (because moving values between integer and FP registers is
quite expensive).  If a value of one type has to be synthesized out of
two values of the other type (<code>double</code> types), things are even more
interesting.

   <p>One way around this problem would be to not use the <code>spTOS</code>
supported by Vmgen, but to use explicit top-of-stack variables (one for
integers, one for FP values), and having a kind of accumulator+stack
architecture (e.g., Ocaml bytecode uses this approach); however, this is
a major change, and it's ramifications are not completely clear.
