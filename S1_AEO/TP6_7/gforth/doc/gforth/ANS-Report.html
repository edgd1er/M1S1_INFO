This manual is for Gforth (version 0.7.0, November 2, 2008),
a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth language.  It
serves as reference manual, but it also contains an introduction to
Forth and a Forth tutorial.

<h3 class="section">7.1 <samp><span class="file">ans-report.fs</span></samp>: Report the words used, sorted by wordset</h3>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007bans_002dreport_002efs_007d-3048"></a><a name="index-report-the-words-used-in-your-program-3049"></a><a name="index-words-used-in-your-program-3050"></a>
If you want to label a Forth program as ANS Forth Program, you must
document which wordsets the program uses; for extension wordsets, it is
helpful to list the words the program requires from these wordsets
(because Forth systems are allowed to provide only some words of them).

   <p>The <samp><span class="file">ans-report.fs</span></samp> tool makes it easy for you to determine which
words from which wordset and which non-ANS words your application
uses. You simply have to include <samp><span class="file">ans-report.fs</span></samp> before loading the
program you want to check. After loading your program, you can get the
report with <code>print-ans-report</code>. A typical use is to run this as
batch job like this:
<pre class="example">     gforth ans-report.fs myprog.fs -e "print-ans-report bye"
</pre>
   <p>The output looks like this (for <samp><span class="file">compat/control.fs</span></samp>):
<pre class="example">     The program uses the following words
     from CORE :
     : POSTPONE THEN ; immediate ?dup IF 0=
     from BLOCK-EXT :
     \
     from FILE :
     (
</pre>
   <h4 class="subsection">7.1.1 Caveats</h4>

<p>Note that <samp><span class="file">ans-report.fs</span></samp> just checks which words are used, not whether
they are used in an ANS Forth conforming way!

   <p>Some words are defined in several wordsets in the
standard. <samp><span class="file">ans-report.fs</span></samp> reports them for only one of the
wordsets, and not necessarily the one you expect. It depends on usage
which wordset is the right one to specify. E.g., if you only use the
compilation semantics of <code>S"</code>, it is a Core word; if you also use
its interpretation semantics, it is a File word.
