This manual is for Gforth (version 0.7.0, November 2, 2008),
a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth language.  It
serves as reference manual, but it also contains an introduction to
Forth and a Forth tutorial.

<h5 class="subsubsection">5.21.1.3 Locals programming style</h5>

<p><a name="index-locals-programming-style-2276"></a><a name="index-programming-style_002c-locals-2277"></a>
The freedom to define locals anywhere has the potential to change
programming styles dramatically. In particular, the need to use the
return stack for intermediate storage vanishes. Moreover, all stack
manipulations (except <code>PICK</code>s and <code>ROLL</code>s with run-time
determined arguments) can be eliminated: If the stack items are in the
wrong order, just write a locals definition for all of them; then
write the items in the order you want.

   <p>This seems a little far-fetched and eliminating stack manipulations is
unlikely to become a conscious programming objective. Still, the number
of stack manipulations will be reduced dramatically if local variables
are used liberally (e.g., compare <code>max</code> (see <a href="Gforth-locals.html#Gforth-locals">Gforth locals</a>) with
a traditional implementation of <code>max</code>).

   <p>This shows one potential benefit of locals: making Forth programs more
readable. Of course, this benefit will only be realized if the
programmers continue to honour the principle of factoring instead of
using the added latitude to make the words longer.

   <p><a name="index-single_002dassignment-style-for-locals-2278"></a>Using <code>TO</code> can and should be avoided.  Without <code>TO</code>,
every value-flavoured local has only a single assignment and many
advantages of functional languages apply to Forth. I.e., programs are
easier to analyse, to optimize and to read: It is clear from the
definition what the local stands for, it does not turn into something
different later.

   <p>E.g., a definition using <code>TO</code> might look like this:
<pre class="example">     : strcmp { addr1 u1 addr2 u2 -- n }
      u1 u2 min 0
      ?do
        addr1 c@ addr2 c@ -
        ?dup-if
          unloop exit
        then
        addr1 char+ TO addr1
        addr2 char+ TO addr2
      loop
      u1 u2 - ;
</pre>
   <p>Here, <code>TO</code> is used to update <code>addr1</code> and <code>addr2</code> at
every loop iteration. <code>strcmp</code> is a typical example of the
readability problems of using <code>TO</code>. When you start reading
<code>strcmp</code>, you think that <code>addr1</code> refers to the start of the
string. Only near the end of the loop you realize that it is something
else.

   <p>This can be avoided by defining two locals at the start of the loop that
are initialized with the right value for the current iteration.
<pre class="example">     : strcmp { addr1 u1 addr2 u2 -- n }
      addr1 addr2
      u1 u2 min 0
      ?do { s1 s2 }
        s1 c@ s2 c@ -
        ?dup-if
          unloop exit
        then
        s1 char+ s2 char+
      loop
      2drop
      u1 u2 - ;
</pre>
   <p>Here it is clear from the start that <code>s1</code> has a different value
in every loop iteration.
