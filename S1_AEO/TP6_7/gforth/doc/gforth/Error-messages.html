This manual is for Gforth (version 0.7.0, November 2, 2008),
a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth language.  It
serves as reference manual, but it also contains an introduction to
Forth and a Forth tutorial.

<h2 class="chapter">6 Error messages</h2>

<p><a name="index-error-messages-3041"></a><a name="index-backtrace-3042"></a>
A typical Gforth error message looks like this:

<pre class="example">     in file included from \evaluated string/:-1
     in file included from ./yyy.fs:1
     ./xxx.fs:4: Invalid memory address
     &gt;&gt;&gt;bar&lt;&lt;&lt;
     Backtrace:
     $400E664C @
     $400E6664 foo
</pre>
   <p>The message identifying the error is <code>Invalid memory address</code>.  The
error happened when text-interpreting line 4 of the file
<samp><span class="file">./xxx.fs</span></samp>. This line is given (it contains <code>bar</code>), and the
word on the line where the error happened, is pointed out (with
<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;</code>).

   <p>The file containing the error was included in line 1 of <samp><span class="file">./yyy.fs</span></samp>,
and <samp><span class="file">yyy.fs</span></samp> was included from a non-file (in this case, by giving
<samp><span class="file">yyy.fs</span></samp> as command-line parameter to Gforth).

   <p>At the end of the error message you find a return stack dump that can be
interpreted as a backtrace (possibly empty). On top you find the top of
the return stack when the <code>throw</code> happened, and at the bottom you
find the return stack entry just above the return stack of the topmost
text interpreter.

   <p>To the right of most return stack entries you see a guess for the word
that pushed that return stack entry as its return address. This gives a
backtrace. In our case we see that <code>bar</code> called <code>foo</code>, and
<code>foo</code> called <code>@</code> (and <code>@</code> had an <em>Invalid memory
address</em> exception).

   <p>Note that the backtrace is not perfect: We don't know which return stack
entries are return addresses (so we may get false positives); and in
some cases (e.g., for <code>abort"</code>) we cannot determine from the return
address the word that pushed the return address, so for some return
addresses you see no names in the return stack dump.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bcatch_007d-and-backtraces-3043"></a>The return stack dump represents the return stack at the time when a
specific <code>throw</code> was executed.  In programs that make use of
<code>catch</code>, it is not necessarily clear which <code>throw</code> should be
used for the return stack dump (e.g., consider one <code>throw</code> that
indicates an error, which is caught, and during recovery another error
happens; which <code>throw</code> should be used for the stack dump?). 
Gforth presents the return stack dump for the first <code>throw</code> after
the last executed (not returned-to) <code>catch</code> or <code>nothrow</code>;
this works well in the usual case. To get the right backtrace, you
usually want to insert <code>nothrow</code> or <code>['] false catch drop</code>
after a <code>catch</code> if the error is not rethrown.

from primitives (e.g., invalid memory address, stack empty etc.);
<code>gforth-fast</code> is only able to do a return stack dump from a
directly called <code>throw</code> (including <code>abort</code> etc.).  Given an
exception caused by a primitive in <code>gforth-fast</code>, you will
typically see no return stack dump at all; however, if the exception is
caught by <code>catch</code> (e.g., for restoring some state), and then
<code>throw</code>n again, the return stack dump will be for the first such
<code>throw</code>.
