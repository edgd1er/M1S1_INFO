This manual is for Gforth (version 0.7.0, November 2, 2008),
a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth language.  It
serves as reference manual, but it also contains an introduction to
Forth and a Forth tutorial.

<h4 class="subsection">5.23.6 Comparison with other object models</h4>

<p><a name="index-comparison-of-object-models-2776"></a><a name="index-object-models_002c-comparison-2777"></a>
Many object-oriented Forth extensions have been proposed (<cite>A survey
of object-oriented Forths</cite> (SIGPLAN Notices, April 1996) by Bradford
J. Rodriguez and W. F. S. Poehlman lists 17). This section discusses the
relation of the object models described here to two well-known and two
closely-related (by the use of method maps) models.  Andras Zsoter
helped us with this section.

   <p><a name="index-Neon-model-2778"></a>The most popular model currently seems to be the Neon model (see
<cite>Object-oriented programming in ANS Forth</cite> (Forth Dimensions, March
1997) by Andrew McKewan) but this model has a number of limitations
<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>:

     <ul>
<li>It uses a <em>selector object</em> syntax, which makes it unnatural
to pass objects on the stack.

     <li>It requires that the selector parses the input stream (at
compile time); this leads to reduced extensibility and to bugs that are
hard to find.

     <li>It allows using every selector on every object; this eliminates the
need for interfaces, but makes it harder to create efficient
implementations. 
</ul>

   <p><a name="index-Pountain_0027s-object_002doriented-model-2779"></a>Another well-known publication is <cite>Object-Oriented Forth</cite> (Academic
Press, London, 1987) by Dick Pountain. However, it is not really about
object-oriented programming, because it hardly deals with late
binding. Instead, it focuses on features like information hiding and
overloading that are characteristic of modular languages like Ada (83).

   <p><a name="index-Zsoter_0027s-object_002doriented-model-2780"></a>In <a href="http://www.forth.org/oopf.html">Does late binding have to be slow?</a> (Forth Dimensions 18(1) 1996, pages 31-35) Andras Zsoter
describes a model that makes heavy use of an active object (like
<code>this</code> in <samp><span class="file">objects.fs</span></samp>): The active object is not only used
for accessing all fields, but also specifies the receiving object of
every selector invocation; you have to change the active object
explicitly with <code>{ ... }</code>, whereas in <samp><span class="file">objects.fs</span></samp> it
changes more or less implicitly at <code>m: ... ;m</code>. Such a change at
the method entry point is unnecessary with Zsoter's model, because the
receiving object is the active object already. On the other hand, the
explicit change is absolutely necessary in that model, because otherwise
no one could ever change the active object. An ANS Forth implementation
of this model is available through
<a href="http://www.forth.org/oopf.html">http://www.forth.org/oopf.html</a>.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007boof_002efs_007d_002c-differences-to-other-models-2781"></a>The <samp><span class="file">oof.fs</span></samp> model combines information hiding and overloading
resolution (by keeping names in various word lists) with object-oriented
programming. It sets the active object implicitly on method entry, but
also allows explicit changing (with <code>&gt;o...o&gt;</code> or with
<code>with...endwith</code>). It uses parsing and state-smart objects and
classes for resolving overloading and for early binding: the object or
class parses the selector and determines the method from this. If the
selector is not parsed by an object or class, it performs a call to the
selector for the active object (late binding), like Zsoter's model. 
Fields are always accessed through the active object. The big
disadvantage of this model is the parsing and the state-smartness, which
reduces extensibility and increases the opportunities for subtle bugs;
essentially, you are only safe if you never tick or <code>postpone</code> an
object or class (Bernd disagrees, but I (Anton) am not convinced).

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007bmini_002doof_002efs_007d_002c-differences-to-other-models-2782"></a>The <samp><span class="file">mini-oof.fs</span></samp> model is quite similar to a very stripped-down
version of the <samp><span class="file">objects.fs</span></samp> model, but syntactically it is a
mixture of the <samp><span class="file">objects.fs</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">oof.fs</span></samp> models.
