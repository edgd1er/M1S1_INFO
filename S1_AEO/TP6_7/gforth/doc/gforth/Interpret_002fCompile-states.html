This manual is for Gforth (version 0.7.0, November 2, 2008),
a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth language.  It
serves as reference manual, but it also contains an introduction to
Forth and a Forth tutorial.

<h4 class="subsection">5.13.3 Interpret/Compile states</h4>

<p><a name="index-Interpret_002fCompile-states-1502"></a>
A standard program is not permitted to change <code>state</code>
explicitly. However, it can change <code>state</code> implicitly, using the
words <code>[</code> and <code>]</code>. When <code>[</code> is executed it switches
<code>state</code> to interpret state, and therefore the text interpreter
starts interpreting. When <code>]</code> is executed it switches <code>state</code>
to compile state and therefore the text interpreter starts
compiling. The most common usage for these words is for switching into
interpret state and back from within a colon definition; this technique
can be used to compile a literal (for an example, see <a href="Literals.html#Literals">Literals</a>) or
for conditional compilation (for an example, see <a href="Interpreter-Directives.html#Interpreter-Directives">Interpreter Directives</a>).

<!-- This is a bad example: It's non-standard, and it's not necessary. -->
<!-- However, I can't think of a good example for switching into compile -->
<!-- state when there is no current word (@code{state}-smart words are not a -->
<!-- good reason).  So maybe we should use an example for switching into -->
<!-- interpret @code{state} in a colon def. - anton -->
<!-- nac-> I agree. I started out by putting in the example, then realised -->
<!-- that it was non-ANS, so wrote more words around it. I hope this -->
<!-- re-written version is acceptable to you. I do want to keep the example -->
<!-- as it is helpful for showing what is and what is not portable, particularly -->
<!-- where it outlaws a style in common use. -->
<!-- anton: it's more important to show what's portable.  After we have done -->
<!-- that, we can also show what's not.  In any case, I have written a -->
<!-- section Compiling Words which also deals with [ ]. -->
<!-- !! The following example does not work in Gforth 0.5.9 or later. -->
<!-- @code{[} and @code{]} also give you the ability to switch into compile -->
<!-- state and back, but we cannot think of any useful Standard application -->
<!-- for this ability. Pre-ANS Forth textbooks have examples like this: -->
<!-- @example -->
<!-- : AA ." this is A" ; -->
<!-- : BB ." this is B" ; -->
<!-- : CC ." this is C" ; -->
<!-- create table ] aa bb cc [ -->
<!-- : go ( n - ) \ n is offset into table.. 0 for 1st entry -->
<!-- cells table + @@ execute ; -->
<!-- @end example -->
<!-- This example builds a jump table; @code{0 go} will display ``@code{this -->
<!-- is A}''. Using @code{[} and @code{]} in this example is equivalent to -->
<!-- defining @code{table} like this: -->
<!-- @example -->
<!-- create table ' aa COMPILE, ' bb COMPILE, ' cc COMPILE, -->
<!-- @end example -->
<!-- The problem with this code is that the definition of @code{table} is not -->
<!-- portable - it @i{compile}s execution tokens into code space. Whilst it -->
<!-- @i{may} work on systems where code space and data space co-incide, the -->
<!-- Standard only allows data space to be assigned for a @code{CREATE}d -->
<!-- word. In addition, the Standard only allows @code{@@} to access data -->
<!-- space, whilst this example is using it to access code space. The only -->
<!-- portable, Standard way to build this table is to build it in data space, -->
<!-- like this: -->
<!-- @example -->
<!-- create table ' aa , ' bb , ' cc , -->
<!-- @end example -->
<!-- doc-state -->
