This manual is for Gforth (version 0.7.0, November 2, 2008),
a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth language.  It
serves as reference manual, but it also contains an introduction to
Forth and a Forth tutorial.

<h2 class="chapter">9 Should I use Gforth extensions?</h2>

<p><a name="index-Gforth-extensions-3358"></a>
As you read through the rest of this manual, you will see documentation
for <i>Standard</i> words, and documentation for some appealing Gforth
<i>extensions</i>. You might ask yourself the question: <i>&ldquo;Should I
restrict myself to the standard, or should I use the extensions?&rdquo;</i>

   <p>The answer depends on the goals you have for the program you are working
on:

     <ul>
<li>Is it just for yourself or do you want to share it with others?

     <li>If you want to share it, do the others all use Gforth?

     <li>If it is just for yourself, do you want to restrict yourself to Gforth?

   </ul>

   <p>If restricting the program to Gforth is ok, then there is no reason not
to use extensions.  It is still a good idea to keep to the standard
where it is easy, in case you want to reuse these parts in another
program that you want to be portable.

   <p>If you want to be able to port the program to other Forth systems, there
are the following points to consider:

     <ul>
<li>Most Forth systems that are being maintained support the ANS Forth
standard.  So if your program complies with the standard, it will be
portable among many systems.

     <li>A number of the Gforth extensions can be implemented in ANS Forth using
public-domain files provided in the <samp><span class="file">compat/</span></samp> directory. These are
mentioned in the text in passing.  There is no reason not to use these
extensions, your program will still be ANS Forth compliant; just include
the appropriate compat files with your program.

     <li>The tool <samp><span class="file">ans-report.fs</span></samp> (see <a href="ANS-Report.html#ANS-Report">ANS Report</a>) makes it easy to
analyse your program and determine what non-Standard words it relies
upon.  However, it does not check whether you use standard words in a
non-standard way.

     <li>Some techniques are not standardized by ANS Forth, and are hard or
impossible to implement in a standard way, but can be implemented in
most Forth systems easily, and usually in similar ways (e.g., accessing
word headers).  Forth has a rich historical precedent for programmers
taking advantage of implementation-dependent features of their tools
(for example, relying on a knowledge of the dictionary
structure). Sometimes these techniques are necessary to extract every
last bit of performance from the hardware, sometimes they are just a
programming shorthand.

     <li>Does using a Gforth extension save more work than the porting this part
to other Forth systems (if any) will cost?

     <li>Is the additional functionality worth the reduction in portability and
the additional porting problems?

   </ul>

   <p>In order to perform these consideratios, you need to know what's
standard and what's not.  This manual generally states if something is
non-standard, but the authoritative source is the
<a href="http://www.taygeta.com/forth/dpans.html">standard document</a>. 
Appendix A of the Standard (<var>Rationale</var>) provides a valuable insight
into the thought processes of the technical committee.

   <p>Note also that portability between Forth systems is not the only
portability issue; there is also the issue of portability between
different platforms (processor/OS combinations).
