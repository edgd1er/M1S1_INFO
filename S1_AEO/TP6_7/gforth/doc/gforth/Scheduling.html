This manual is for Gforth (version 0.7.0, November 2, 2008),
a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth language.  It
serves as reference manual, but it also contains an introduction to
Forth and a Forth tutorial.

<h4 class="subsection">14.2.1 Scheduling</h4>

<p><a name="index-inner-interpreter-optimization-3468"></a>
There is a little complication: Pipelined and superscalar processors,
i.e., RISC and some modern CISC machines can process independent
instructions while waiting for the results of an instruction. The
compiler usually reorders (schedules) the instructions in a way that
achieves good usage of these delay slots. However, on our first tries
the compiler did not do well on scheduling primitives. E.g., for
<code>+</code> implemented as
<pre class="example">     n=sp[0]+sp[1];
     sp++;
     sp[0]=n;
     NEXT;
</pre>
   <p>the <code>NEXT</code> comes strictly after the other code, i.e., there is
nearly no scheduling. After a little thought the problem becomes clear:
The compiler cannot know that <code>sp</code> and <code>ip</code> point to different
addresses (and the version of <code>gcc</code> we used would not know it even
if it was possible), so it could not move the load of the cfa above the
store to the TOS. Indeed the pointers could be the same, if code on or
very near the top of stack were executed. In the interest of speed we
chose to forbid this probably unused &ldquo;feature&rdquo; and helped the compiler
in scheduling: <code>NEXT</code> is divided into several parts:
<code>NEXT_P0</code>, <code>NEXT_P1</code> and <code>NEXT_P2</code>). <code>+</code> now looks
like:
<pre class="example">     NEXT_P0;
     n=sp[0]+sp[1];
     sp++;
     NEXT_P1;
     sp[0]=n;
     NEXT_P2;
</pre>
   <p>There are various schemes that distribute the different operations of
NEXT between these parts in several ways; in general, different schemes
perform best on different processors.  We use a scheme for most
architectures that performs well for most processors of this
architecture; in the future we may switch to benchmarking and chosing
the scheme on installation time.
