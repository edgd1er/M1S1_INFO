This manual is for Gforth (version 0.7.0, November 2, 2008),
a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth language.  It
serves as reference manual, but it also contains an introduction to
Forth and a Forth tutorial.

<h3 class="section">7.2 Stack depth changes during interpretation</h3>

<p><a name="index-g_t_0040file_007bdepth_002dchanges_002efs_007d-3051"></a><a name="index-depth-changes-during-interpretation-3052"></a><a name="index-stack-depth-changes-during-interpretation-3053"></a><a name="index-items-on-the-stack-after-interpretation-3054"></a>
Sometimes you notice that, after loading a file, there are items left
on the stack.  The tool <samp><span class="file">depth-changes.fs</span></samp> helps you find out
quickly where in the file these stack items are coming from.

   <p>The simplest way of using <samp><span class="file">depth-changes.fs</span></samp> is to include it
before the file(s) you want to check, e.g.:

<pre class="example">     gforth depth-changes.fs my-file.fs
</pre>
   <p>This will compare the stack depths of the data and FP stack at every
empty line (in interpretation state) against these depths at the last
empty line (in interpretation state).  If the depths are not equal,
the position in the file and the stack contents are printed with
<code>~~</code> (see <a href="Debugging.html#Debugging">Debugging</a>).  This indicates that a stack depth
change has occured in the paragraph of non-empty lines before the
indicated line.  It is a good idea to leave an empty line at the end
of the file, so the last paragraph is checked, too.

   <p>Checking only at empty lines usually works well, but sometimes you
have big blocks of non-empty lines (e.g., when building a big table),
and you want to know where in this block the stack depth changed.  You
can check all interpreted lines with

<pre class="example">     gforth depth-changes.fs -e "' all-lines is depth-changes-filter" my-file.fs
</pre>
   <p>This checks the stack depth at every end-of-line.  So the depth change
occured in the line reported by the <code>~~</code> (not in the line
before).

   <p>Note that, while this offers better accuracy in indicating where the
stack depth changes, it will often report many intentional stack depth
changes (e.g., when an interpreted computation stretches across
several lines).  You can suppress the checking of some lines by
putting backslashes at the end of these lines (not followed by white
space), and using

<pre class="example">     gforth depth-changes.fs -e "' most-lines is depth-changes-filter" my-file.fs
</pre>
