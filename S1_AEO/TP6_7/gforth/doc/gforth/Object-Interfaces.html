This manual is for Gforth (version 0.7.0, November 2, 2008),
a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth language.  It
serves as reference manual, but it also contains an introduction to
Forth and a Forth tutorial.

<h5 class="subsubsection">5.23.3.10 Object Interfaces</h5>

<p><a name="index-object-interfaces-2492"></a><a name="index-interfaces-for-objects-2493"></a>
In this model you can only call selectors defined in the class of the
receiving objects or in one of its ancestors. If you call a selector
with a receiving object that is not in one of these classes, the
result is undefined; if you are lucky, the program crashes
immediately.

   <p><a name="index-selectors-common-to-hardly_002drelated-classes-2494"></a>Now consider the case when you want to have a selector (or several)
available in two classes: You would have to add the selector to a
common ancestor class, in the worst case to <code>object</code>. You
may not want to do this, e.g., because someone else is responsible for
this ancestor class.

   <p>The solution for this problem is interfaces. An interface is a
collection of selectors. If a class implements an interface, the
selectors become available to the class and its descendents. A class
can implement an unlimited number of interfaces. For the problem
discussed above, we would define an interface for the selector(s), and
both classes would implement the interface.

   <p>As an example, consider an interface <code>storage</code> for
writing objects to disk and getting them back, and a class
<code>foo</code> that implements it. The code would look like this:

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007binterface_007d-usage-2495"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bend_002dinterface_007d-usage-2496"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bimplementation_007d-usage-2497"></a>
<pre class="example">     interface
       selector write ( file object -- )
       selector read1 ( file object -- )
     end-interface storage
     
     bar class
       storage implementation
     
     ... overrides write
     ... overrides read1
     ...
     end-class foo
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(I would add a word <code>read</code> <i>( file &ndash; object )</i> that uses
<code>read1</code> internally, but that's beyond the point illustrated
here.)

   <p>Note that you cannot use <code>protected</code> in an interface; and
of course you cannot define fields.

   <p>In the Neon model, all selectors are available for all classes;
therefore it does not need interfaces. The price you pay in this model
is slower late binding, and therefore, added complexity to avoid late
binding.
