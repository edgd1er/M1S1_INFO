This manual is for Gforth (version 0.7.0, November 2, 2008),
a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth language.  It
serves as reference manual, but it also contains an introduction to
Forth and a Forth tutorial.

<h4 class="subsection">5.21.2 ANS Forth locals</h4>

<p><a name="index-locals_002c-ANS-Forth-style-2318"></a>
The ANS Forth locals wordset does not define a syntax for locals, but
words that make it possible to define various syntaxes. One of the
possible syntaxes is a subset of the syntax we used in the Gforth locals
wordset, i.e.:

<pre class="example">     { local1 local2 ... -- comment }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">or
<pre class="example">     { local1 local2 ... }
</pre>
   <p>The order of the locals corresponds to the order in a stack comment. The
restrictions are:

     <ul>
<li>Locals can only be cell-sized values (no type specifiers are allowed). 
<li>Locals can be defined only outside control structures. 
<li>Locals can interfere with explicit usage of the return stack. For the
exact (and long) rules, see the standard. If you don't use return stack
accessing words in a definition using locals, you will be all right. The
purpose of this rule is to make locals implementation on the return
stack easier. 
<li>The whole definition must be in one line. 
</ul>

   <p>Locals defined in ANS Forth behave like <code>VALUE</code>s
(see <a href="Values.html#Values">Values</a>). I.e., they are initialized from the stack. Using their
name produces their value. Their value can be changed using <code>TO</code>.

   <p>Since the syntax above is supported by Gforth directly, you need not do
anything to use it. If you want to port a program using this syntax to
another ANS Forth system, use <samp><span class="file">compat/anslocal.fs</span></samp> to implement the
syntax on the other system.

   <p>Note that a syntax shown in the standard, section A.13 looks
similar, but is quite different in having the order of locals
reversed. Beware!

   <p>The ANS Forth locals wordset itself consists of one word:

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0028local_0029-_0040var_007b-addr-u-_002d_002d---_007d--local-2319"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_0028local_0029_007d-2320"></a><a name="index-g_t_0028local_0029-2321"></a>
<pre class="format"><code>(local)</code>       <i>addr u &ndash;  </i>       local       &ldquo;paren-local-paren&rdquo;
</pre>
   <p>The ANS Forth locals extension wordset defines a syntax using
<code>locals|</code>, but it is so awful that we strongly recommend not to use
it. We have implemented this syntax to make porting to Gforth easy, but
do not document it here. The problem with this syntax is that the locals
are defined in an order reversed with respect to the standard stack
comment notation, making programs harder to read, and easier to misread
and miswrite. The only merit of this syntax is that it is easy to
implement using the ANS Forth locals wordset.
