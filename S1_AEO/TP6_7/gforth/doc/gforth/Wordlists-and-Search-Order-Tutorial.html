This manual is for Gforth (version 0.7.0, November 2, 2008),
a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth language.  It
serves as reference manual, but it also contains an introduction to
Forth and a Forth tutorial.

<h3 class="section">3.37 Wordlists and Search Order</h3>

<p><a name="index-wordlists-tutorial-134"></a><a name="index-search-order_002c-tutorial-135"></a>
The dictionary is not just a memory area that allows you to allocate
memory with <code>allot</code>, it also contains the Forth words, arranged in
several wordlists.  When searching for a word in a wordlist,
conceptually you start searching at the youngest and proceed towards
older words (in reality most systems nowadays use hash-tables); i.e., if
you define a word with the same name as an older word, the new word
shadows the older word.

   <p>Which wordlists are searched in which order is determined by the search
order.  You can display the search order with <code>order</code>.  It displays
first the search order, starting with the wordlist searched first, then
it displays the wordlist that will contain newly defined words.

   <p>You can create a new, empty wordlist with <code>wordlist ( -- wid )</code>:

<pre class="example">     wordlist constant mywords
</pre>
   <p><code>Set-current ( wid -- )</code> sets the wordlist that will contain newly
defined words (the <em>current</em> wordlist):

<pre class="example">     mywords set-current
     order
</pre>
   <p>Gforth does not display a name for the wordlist in <code>mywords</code>
because this wordlist was created anonymously with <code>wordlist</code>.

   <p>You can get the current wordlist with <code>get-current ( -- wid)</code>.  If
you want to put something into a specific wordlist without overall
effect on the current wordlist, this typically looks like this:

<pre class="example">     get-current mywords set-current ( wid )
     create someword
     ( wid ) set-current
</pre>
   <p>You can write the search order with <code>set-order ( wid1 .. widn n --
)</code> and read it with <code>get-order ( -- wid1 .. widn n )</code>.  The first
searched wordlist is topmost.

<pre class="example">     get-order mywords swap 1+ set-order
     order
</pre>
   <p>Yes, the order of wordlists in the output of <code>order</code> is reversed
from stack comments and the output of <code>.s</code> and thus unintuitive.

   <blockquote>
<b>Assignment:</b> Define <code>&gt;order ( wid -- )</code> with adds <code>wid</code> as first searched
wordlist to the search order.  Define <code>previous ( -- )</code>, which
removes the first searched wordlist from the search order.  Experiment
with boundary conditions (you will see some crashes or situations that
are hard or impossible to leave). 
</blockquote>

   <p>The search order is a powerful foundation for providing features similar
to Modula-2 modules and C++ namespaces.  However, trying to modularize
programs in this way has disadvantages for debugging and reuse/factoring
that overcome the advantages in my experience (I don't do huge projects,
though).  These disadvantages are not so clear in other
languages/programming environments, because these languages are not so
strong in debugging and reuse.
