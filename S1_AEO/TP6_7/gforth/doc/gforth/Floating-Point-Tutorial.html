This manual is for Gforth (version 0.7.0, November 2, 2008),
a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth language.  It
serves as reference manual, but it also contains an introduction to
Forth and a Forth tutorial.

<h3 class="section">3.26 Floating Point</h3>

<p><a name="index-floating-point-tutorial-112"></a><a name="index-FP-tutorial-113"></a>
Floating-point (FP) numbers and arithmetic in Forth works mostly as one
might expect, but there are a few things worth noting:

   <p>The first point is not specific to Forth, but so important and yet not
universally known that I mention it here: FP numbers are not reals. 
Many properties (e.g., arithmetic laws) that reals have and that one
expects of all kinds of numbers do not hold for FP numbers.  If you
want to use FP computations, you should learn about their problems and
how to avoid them; a good starting point is <cite>David Goldberg,
<a href="http://docs.sun.com/source/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html">What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic</a>, ACM
Computing Surveys 23(1):5&minus;48, March 1991</cite>.

   <p>In Forth source code literal FP numbers need an exponent, e.g.,
<code>1e0</code>; this can also be written shorter as <code>1e</code>,
<code>+1.0e+0</code>, and many variations in between.  The reason for this
is that, for historical reasons, Forth interprets a decimal point
alone (e.g., <code>1.</code>) as indicating a double-cell integer.  Another
requirement for literal FP numbers is that the current base is
decimal; with a hex base <code>1e</code> is interpreted as an integer.

   <p>Forth has a separate stack for FP numbers.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>  One advantage of this model is that cells are not in the
way when accessing FP values, and vice versa.  Forth has a set of
words for manipulating the FP stack: <code>fdup fswap fdrop fover
frot</code> and (non-standard) <code>fnip ftuck fpick</code>.

   <p>FP arithmetic words are prefixed with <code>F</code>.  There is the usual
set <code>f+ f- f* f/ f** fnegate</code> as well as a number of words for
other functions, e.g., <code>fsqrt fsin fln fmin</code>.  One word that you
might expect is <code>f=</code>; but <code>f=</code> is non-standard, because FP
computation results are usually inaccurate, so exact comparison is
usually a mistake, and one should use approximate comparison. 
Unfortunately, <code>f~</code>, the standard word for that purpose, is not
well designed, so Gforth provides <code>f~abs</code> and <code>f~rel</code> as
well.

   <p>And of course there are words for accessing FP numbers in memory
(<code>f@ f!</code>), and for address arithmetic (<code>floats float+
faligned</code>).  There are also variants of these words with an <code>sf</code>
and <code>df</code> prefix for accessing IEEE format single-precision and
double-precision numbers in memory; their main purpose is for
accessing external FP data (e.g., that has been read from or will be
written to a file).

   <p>Here is an example of a dot-product word and its use:

<pre class="example">     : v* ( f_addr1 nstride1 f_addr2 nstride2 ucount -- r )
       &gt;r swap 2swap swap 0e r&gt; 0 ?DO
         dup f@ over + 2swap dup f@ f* f+ over + 2swap
       LOOP
       2drop 2drop ;
     
     create v 1.23e f, 4.56e f, 7.89e f,
     
     v 1 floats  v 1 floats  3  v* f.
</pre>

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> Theoretically, an
ANS Forth system may implement the FP stack on the data stack, but
virtually all systems implement a separate FP stack; and programming
in a way that accommodates all models is so cumbersome that nobody
does it.</p>
