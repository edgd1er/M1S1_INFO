This manual is for Gforth (version 0.7.0, November 2, 2008),
a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth language.  It
serves as reference manual, but it also contains an introduction to
Forth and a Forth tutorial.

<h3 class="section">3.32 Arrays and Records</h3>

<p><a name="index-arrays-tutorial-125"></a><a name="index-records-tutorial-126"></a><a name="index-structs-tutorial-127"></a>
Forth has no standard words for defining data structures such as arrays
and records (structs in C terminology), but you can build them yourself
based on address arithmetic.  You can also define words for defining
arrays and records (see <a href="Defining-Words-Tutorial.html#Defining-Words-Tutorial">Defining Words</a>).

   <p>One of the first projects a Forth newcomer sets out upon when learning
about defining words is an array defining word (possibly for
n-dimensional arrays).  Go ahead and do it, I did it, too; you will
learn something from it.  However, don't be disappointed when you later
learn that you have little use for these words (inappropriate use would
be even worse).  I have not found a set of useful array words yet;
the needs are just too diverse, and named, global arrays (the result of
naive use of defining words) are often not flexible enough (e.g.,
consider how to pass them as parameters).  Another such project is a set
of words to help dealing with strings.

   <p>On the other hand, there is a useful set of record words, and it has
been defined in <samp><span class="file">compat/struct.fs</span></samp>; these words are predefined in
Gforth.  They are explained in depth elsewhere in this manual (see
see <a href="Structures.html#Structures">Structures</a>).  The <code>simple-field</code> example above is
simplified variant of fields in this package.
