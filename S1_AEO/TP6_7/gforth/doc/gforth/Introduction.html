This manual is for Gforth (version 0.7.0, November 2, 2008),
a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth language.  It
serves as reference manual, but it also contains an introduction to
Forth and a Forth tutorial.

<h2 class="chapter">4 An Introduction to ANS Forth</h2>

<p><a name="index-Forth-_002d-an-introduction-136"></a>
The difference of this chapter from the Tutorial (see <a href="Tutorial.html#Tutorial">Tutorial</a>) is
that it is slower-paced in its examples, but uses them to dive deep into
explaining Forth internals (not covered by the Tutorial).  Apart from
that, this chapter covers far less material.  It is suitable for reading
without using a computer.

   <p>The primary purpose of this manual is to document Gforth. However, since
Forth is not a widely-known language and there is a lack of up-to-date
teaching material, it seems worthwhile to provide some introductory
material.  For other sources of Forth-related
information, see <a href="Forth_002drelated-information.html#Forth_002drelated-information">Forth-related information</a>.

   <p>The examples in this section should work on any ANS Forth; the
output shown was produced using Gforth. Each example attempts to
reproduce the exact output that Gforth produces. If you try out the
examples (and you should), what you should type is shown <kbd>like this</kbd>
and Gforth's response is shown <code>like this</code>. The single exception is
that, where the example shows &lt;RET&gt; it means that you should
press the &ldquo;carriage return&rdquo; key. Unfortunately, some output formats for
this manual cannot show the difference between <kbd>this</kbd> and
<code>this</code> which will make trying out the examples harder (but not
impossible).

   <p>Forth is an unusual language. It provides an interactive development
environment which includes both an interpreter and compiler. Forth
programming style encourages you to break a problem down into many
<a name="index-factoring-137"></a>small fragments (<dfn>factoring</dfn>), and then to develop and test each
fragment interactively. Forth advocates assert that breaking the
edit-compile-test cycle used by conventional programming languages can
lead to great productivity improvements.
