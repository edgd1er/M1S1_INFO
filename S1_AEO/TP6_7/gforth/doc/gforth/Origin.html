This manual is for Gforth (version 0.7.0, November 2, 2008),
a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth language.  It
serves as reference manual, but it also contains an introduction to
Forth and a Forth tutorial.

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix B Authors and Ancestors of Gforth</h2>

<h3 class="section">B.1 Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p><a name="index-authors-of-Gforth-3515"></a><a name="index-contributors-to-Gforth-3516"></a>
The Gforth project was started in mid-1992 by Bernd Paysan and Anton
Ertl. The third major author was Jens Wilke.  Neal Crook contributed a
lot to the manual.  Assemblers and disassemblers were contributed by
Andrew McKewan, Christian Pirker, Bernd Thallner, and Michal Revucky. 
Lennart Benschop (who was one of Gforth's first users, in mid-1993)
and Stuart Ramsden inspired us with their continuous feedback. Lennart
Benshop contributed <samp><span class="file">glosgen.fs</span></samp>, while Stuart Ramsden has been
working on automatic support for calling C libraries. Helpful comments
also came from Paul Kleinrubatscher, Christian Pirker, Dirk Zoller,
Marcel Hendrix, John Wavrik, Barrie Stott, Marc de Groot, Jorge
Acerada, Bruce Hoyt, Robert Epprecht, Dennis Ruffer and David
N. Williams. Since the release of Gforth-0.2.1 there were also helpful
comments from many others; thank you all, sorry for not listing you
here (but digging through my mailbox to extract your names is on my
to-do list).

   <p>Gforth also owes a lot to the authors of the tools we used (GCC, CVS,
and autoconf, among others), and to the creators of the Internet: Gforth
was developed across the Internet, and its authors did not meet
physically for the first 4 years of development.

<h3 class="section">B.2 Pedigree</h3>

<p><a name="index-pedigree-of-Gforth-3517"></a>
Gforth descends from bigFORTH (1993) and fig-Forth.  Of course, a
significant part of the design of Gforth was prescribed by ANS Forth.

   <p>Bernd Paysan wrote bigFORTH, a descendent from TurboForth, an unreleased
32 bit native code version of VolksForth for the Atari ST, written
mostly by Dietrich Weineck.

   <p>VolksForth was written by Klaus Schleisiek, Bernd Pennemann, Georg
Rehfeld and Dietrich Weineck for the C64 (called UltraForth there) in
the mid-80s and ported to the Atari ST in 1986.  It descends from fig-Forth.

<!-- Henry Laxen and Mike Perry wrote F83 as a model implementation of the -->
<!-- Forth-83 standard. !! Pedigree? When? -->
<p>A team led by Bill Ragsdale implemented fig-Forth on many processors in
1979. Robert Selzer and Bill Ragsdale developed the original
implementation of fig-Forth for the 6502 based on microForth.

   <p>The principal architect of microForth was Dean Sanderson. microForth was
FORTH, Inc.'s first off-the-shelf product. It was developed in 1976 for
the 1802, and subsequently implemented on the 8080, the 6800 and the
Z80.

   <p>All earlier Forth systems were custom-made, usually by Charles Moore,
who discovered (as he puts it) Forth during the late 60s. The first full
Forth existed in 1971.

   <p>A part of the information in this section comes from
<cite><a href="http://www.forth.com/Content/History/History1.htm">The Evolution of Forth</a></cite> by Elizabeth D. Rather, Donald R. Colburn and
Charles H. Moore, presented at the HOPL-II conference and preprinted
in SIGPLAN Notices 28(3), 1993.  You can find more historical and
genealogical information about Forth there.  For a more general (and
graphical) Forth family tree look see
