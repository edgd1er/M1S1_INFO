This manual is for Gforth (version 0.7.0, November 2, 2008),
a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth language.  It
serves as reference manual, but it also contains an introduction to
Forth and a Forth tutorial.

<p><a name="index-path-for-_0040code_007bincluded_007d-1800"></a><a name="index-file-search-path-1801"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007binclude_007d-search-path-1802"></a><a name="index-search-path-for-files-1803"></a>
If you specify an absolute filename (i.e., a filename starting with
<samp><span class="file">/</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">~</span></samp>, or with <samp><span class="file">:</span></samp> in the second position (as in
`<samp><span class="samp">C:...</span></samp>')) for <code>included</code> and friends, that file is included
just as you would expect.

   <p>If the filename starts with <samp><span class="file">./</span></samp>, this refers to the directory that
the present file was <code>included</code> from.  This allows files to include
other files relative to their own position (irrespective of the current
working directory or the absolute position).  This feature is essential
for libraries consisting of several files, where a file may include
other files from the library.  It corresponds to <code>#include "..."</code>
in C. If the current input source is not a file, <samp><span class="file">.</span></samp> refers to the
directory of the innermost file being included, or, if there is no file
being included, to the current working directory.

   <p>For relative filenames (not starting with <samp><span class="file">./</span></samp>), Gforth uses a
search path similar to Forth's search order (see <a href="Word-Lists.html#Word-Lists">Word Lists</a>). It
tries to find the given filename in the directories present in the path,
and includes the first one it finds. There are separate search paths for
Forth source files and general files.  If the search path contains the
directory <samp><span class="file">.</span></samp>, this refers to the directory of the current file, or
the working directory, as if the file had been specified with <samp><span class="file">./</span></samp>.

   <p>Use <samp><span class="file">~+</span></samp> to refer to the current working directory (as in the
<code>bash</code>).
