This manual is for Gforth (version 0.7.0, November 2, 2008),
a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth language.  It
serves as reference manual, but it also contains an introduction to
Forth and a Forth tutorial.

Amazing as it may seem, if you have read (and understood) this far, you
know almost all the fundamentals about the inner workings of a Forth
system. You certainly know enough to be able to read and understand the
rest of this manual and the ANS Forth document, to learn more about the
facilities that Forth in general and Gforth in particular provide. Even
scarier, you know almost enough to implement your own Forth system. 
However, that's not a good idea just yet... better to try writing some
programs in Gforth.

   <p>Forth has such a rich vocabulary that it can be hard to know where to
start in learning it. This section suggests a few sets of words that are
enough to write small but useful programs. Use the word index in this
document to learn more about each word, then try it out and try to write
small definitions using it. Start by experimenting with these words:

     <ul>
<li>Arithmetic: <code>+ - * / /MOD */ ABS INVERT</code>
<li>Comparison: <code>MIN MAX =</code>
<li>Logic: <code>AND OR XOR NOT</code>
<li>Stack manipulation: <code>DUP DROP SWAP OVER</code>
<li>Loops and decisions: <code>IF ELSE ENDIF ?DO I LOOP</code>
<li>Input/Output: <code>. ." EMIT CR KEY</code>
<li>Defining words: <code>: ; CREATE</code>
<li>Memory allocation words: <code>ALLOT ,</code>
<li>Tools: <code>SEE WORDS .S MARKER</code>
</ul>

   <p>When you have mastered those, go on to:

     <ul>
<li>More defining words: <code>VARIABLE CONSTANT VALUE TO CREATE DOES&gt;</code>
<li>Memory access: <code>@ !</code>
</ul>

   <p>When you have mastered these, there's nothing for it but to read through
the whole of this manual and find out what you've missed.
