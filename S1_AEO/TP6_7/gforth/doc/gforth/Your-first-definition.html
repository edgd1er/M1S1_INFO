This manual is for Gforth (version 0.7.0, November 2, 2008),
a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth language.  It
serves as reference manual, but it also contains an introduction to
Forth and a Forth tutorial.

<h3 class="section">4.3 Your first Forth definition</h3>

<p><a name="index-first-definition-148"></a>
Until now, the examples we've seen have been trivial; we've just been
using Forth as a bigger-than-pocket calculator. Also, each calculation
we've shown has been a &ldquo;one-off&rdquo; &ndash; to repeat it we'd need to type it in
again<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a> In this section we'll see how to add new
words to Forth's vocabulary.

   <p>The easiest way to create a new word is to use a <dfn>colon
definition</dfn>. We'll define a few and try them out before worrying too
much about how they work. Try typing in these examples; be careful to
copy the spaces accurately:

<pre class="example">     : add-two 2 + . ;
     : greet ." Hello and welcome" ;
     : demo 5 add-two ;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Now try them out:

<pre class="example">     <kbd>greet&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> Hello and welcome  ok
     <kbd>greet greet&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> Hello and welcomeHello and welcome  ok
     <kbd>4 add-two&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> 6  ok
     <kbd>demo&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> 7  ok
     <kbd>9 greet demo add-two&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> Hello and welcome7 11  ok
</pre>
   <p>The first new thing that we've introduced here is the pair of words
<code>:</code> and <code>;</code>. These are used to start and terminate a new
definition, respectively. The first word after the <code>:</code> is the name
for the new definition.

   <p>As you can see from the examples, a definition is built up of words that
have already been defined; Forth makes no distinction between
definitions that existed when you started the system up, and those that
you define yourself.

   <p>The examples also introduce the words <code>.</code> (dot), <code>."</code>
(dot-quote) and <code>dup</code> (dewp). Dot takes the value from the top of
the stack and displays it. It's like <code>.s</code> except that it only
displays the top item of the stack and it is destructive; after it has
executed, the number is no longer on the stack. There is always one
space printed after the number, and no spaces before it. Dot-quote
defines a string (a sequence of characters) that will be printed when
the word is executed. The string can contain any printable characters
except <code>"</code>. A <code>"</code> has a special function; it is not a Forth
word but it acts as a delimiter (the way that delimiters work is
described in the next section). Finally, <code>dup</code> duplicates the value
at the top of the stack. Try typing <code>5 dup .s</code> to see what it does.

   <p>We already know that the text interpreter searches through the
dictionary to locate names. If you've followed the examples earlier, you
will already have a definition called <code>add-two</code>. Lets try modifying
it by typing in a new definition:

<pre class="example">     <kbd>: add-two dup . ." + 2 =" 2 + . ;&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> redefined add-two  ok
</pre>
   <p>Forth recognised that we were defining a word that already exists, and
printed a message to warn us of that fact. Let's try out the new
definition:

<pre class="example">     <kbd>9 add-two&lt;RET&gt;</kbd> 9 + 2 =11  ok
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">All that we've actually done here, though, is to create a new
definition, with a particular name. The fact that there was already a
definition with the same name did not make any difference to the way
that the new definition was created (except that Forth printed a warning
message). The old definition of add-two still exists (try <code>demo</code>
again to see that this is true). Any new definition will use the new
definition of <code>add-two</code>, but old definitions continue to use the
version that already existed at the time that they were <code>compiled</code>.

   <p>Before you go on to the next section, try defining and redefining some
words of your own.
