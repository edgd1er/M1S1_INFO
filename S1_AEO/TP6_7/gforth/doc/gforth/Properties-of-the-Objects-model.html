This manual is for Gforth (version 0.7.0, November 2, 2008),
a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth language.  It
serves as reference manual, but it also contains an introduction to
Forth and a Forth tutorial.

     <ul>
<li>It is straightforward to pass objects on the stack. Passing
selectors on the stack is a little less convenient, but possible.

     <li>Objects are just data structures in memory, and are referenced by their
address. You can create words for objects with normal defining words
like <code>constant</code>. Likewise, there is no difference between instance
variables that contain objects and those that contain other data.

     <li>Late binding is efficient and easy to use.

     <li>It avoids parsing, and thus avoids problems with state-smartness
and reduced extensibility; for convenience there are a few parsing
words, but they have non-parsing counterparts. There are also a few
defining words that parse. This is hard to avoid, because all standard
defining words parse (except <code>:noname</code>); however, such
words are not as bad as many other parsing words, because they are not
state-smart.

     <li>It does not try to incorporate everything. It does a few things and does
them well (IMO). In particular, this model was not designed to support
information hiding (although it has features that may help); you can use
a separate package for achieving this.

     <li>It is layered; you don't have to learn and use all features to use this
model. Only a few features are necessary (see <a href="Basic-Objects-Usage.html#Basic-Objects-Usage">Basic Objects Usage</a>,
see <a href="The-Objects-base-class.html#The-Objects-base-class">The Objects base class</a>, see <a href="Creating-objects.html#Creating-objects">Creating objects</a>.), the others
are optional and independent of each other.

     <li>An implementation in ANS Forth is available.

   </ul>
