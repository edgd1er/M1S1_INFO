<h4 class="subsection">5.9.8 User-defined Defining Words</h4>

<p><a name="index-user_002ddefined-defining-words-1250"></a><a name="index-defining-words_002c-user_002ddefined-1251"></a>
You can create a new defining word by wrapping defining-time code around
an existing defining word and putting the sequence in a colon
definition.

<!-- anton: This example is very complex and leads in a quite different -->
<!-- direction from the CREATE-DOES> stuff that follows.  It should probably -->
<!-- be done elsewhere, or as a subsubsection of this subsection (or as a -->
<!-- subsection of Defining Words) -->
<p>For example, suppose that you have a word <code>stats</code> that
gathers statistics about colon definitions given the <i>xt</i> of the
definition, and you want every colon definition in your application to
make a call to <code>stats</code>. You can define and use a new version of
<code>:</code> like this:

<pre class="example">     : stats ( xt -- ) DUP ." (Gathering statistics for " . ." )"
       ... ;  \ other code
     
     : my: : latestxt postpone literal ['] stats compile, ;
     
     my: foo + - ;
</pre>
   <p>When <code>foo</code> is defined using <code>my:</code> these steps occur:

     <ul>
<li><code>my:</code> is executed. 
<li>The <code>:</code> within the definition (the one between <code>my:</code> and
<code>latestxt</code>) is executed, and does just what it always does; it parses
the input stream for a name, builds a dictionary header for the name
<code>foo</code> and switches <code>state</code> from interpret to compile. 
<li>The word <code>latestxt</code> is executed. It puts the <i>xt</i> for the word that is
being defined &ndash; <code>foo</code> &ndash; onto the stack. 
<li>The code that was produced by <code>postpone literal</code> is executed; this
causes the value on the stack to be compiled as a literal in the code
area of <code>foo</code>. 
<li>The code <code>['] stats</code> compiles a literal into the definition of
<code>my:</code>. When <code>compile,</code> is executed, that literal &ndash; the
execution token for <code>stats</code> &ndash; is layed down in the code area of
<code>foo</code> , following the literal<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>. 
<li>At this point, the execution of <code>my:</code> is complete, and control
returns to the text interpreter. The text interpreter is in compile
state, so subsequent text <code>+ -</code> is compiled into the definition of
<code>foo</code> and the <code>;</code> terminates the definition as always. 
</ul>

   <p>You can use <code>see</code> to decompile a word that was defined using
<code>my:</code> and see how it is different from a normal <code>:</code>
definition. For example:

<pre class="example">     : bar + - ;  \ like foo but using : rather than my:
     see bar
     : bar
       + - ;
     see foo
     : foo
       107645672 stats + - ;
     
     \ use ' foo . to show that 107645672 is the xt for foo
</pre>
   <p>You can use techniques like this to make new defining words in terms of
<i>any</i> existing defining word.

   <p><a name="index-defining-defining-words-1252"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bCREATE_007d-_002e_002e_002e-_0040code_007bDOES_003e_007d-1253"></a>If you want the words defined with your defining words to behave
differently from words defined with standard defining words, you can
write your defining word like this:

<pre class="example">     : def-word ( "name" -- )
         CREATE <i>code1</i>
     DOES&gt; ( ... -- ... )
         <i>code2</i> ;
     
     def-word name
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-child-words-1254"></a>This fragment defines a <dfn>defining word</dfn> <code>def-word</code> and then
executes it.  When <code>def-word</code> executes, it <code>CREATE</code>s a new
word, <code>name</code>, and executes the code <i>code1</i>. The code <i>code2</i>
is not executed at this time. The word <code>name</code> is sometimes called a
<dfn>child</dfn> of <code>def-word</code>.

   <p>When you execute <code>name</code>, the address of the body of <code>name</code> is
put on the data stack and <i>code2</i> is executed (the address of the body
of <code>name</code> is the address <code>HERE</code> returns immediately after the
<code>CREATE</code>, i.e., the address a <code>create</code>d word returns by
default).

<!-- anton: -->
<!-- www.dictionary.com says: -->
<!-- at·a·vism: 1.The reappearance of a characteristic in an organism after -->
<!-- several generations of absence, usually caused by the chance -->
<!-- recombination of genes.  2.An individual or a part that exhibits -->
<!-- atavism. Also called throwback.  3.The return of a trait or recurrence -->
<!-- of previous behavior after a period of absence. -->
<!-- Doesn't seem to fit. -->
<!-- @cindex atavism in child words -->
<p>You can use <code>def-word</code> to define a set of child words that behave
similarly; they all have a common run-time behaviour determined by
<i>code2</i>. Typically, the <i>code1</i> sequence builds a data area in the
body of the child word. The structure of the data is common to all
children of <code>def-word</code>, but the data values are specific &ndash; and
private &ndash; to each child word. When a child word is executed, the
address of its private data area is passed as a parameter on TOS to be
used and manipulated<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a> by <i>code2</i>.

   <p>The two fragments of code that make up the defining words act (are
executed) at two completely separate times:

     <ul>
<li>At <i>define time</i>, the defining word executes <i>code1</i> to generate a
child word
<li>At <i>child execution time</i>, when a child word is invoked, <i>code2</i>
is executed, using parameters (data) that are private and specific to
the child word. 
</ul>

   <p>Another way of understanding the behaviour of <code>def-word</code> and
<code>name</code> is to say that, if you make the following definitions:
<pre class="example">     : def-word1 ( "name" -- )
         CREATE <i>code1</i> ;
     
     : action1 ( ... -- ... )
         <i>code2</i> ;
     
     def-word1 name1
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Then using <code>name1 action1</code> is equivalent to using <code>name</code>.

   <p>The classic example is that you can define <code>CONSTANT</code> in this way:

<pre class="example">     : CONSTANT ( w "name" -- )
         CREATE ,
     DOES&gt; ( -- w )
         @ ;
</pre>
   <!-- There is a beautiful description of how this works and what -->
<!-- it does in the Forthwrite 100th edition.. as well as an elegant -->
<!-- commentary on the Counting Fruits problem. -->
<p>When you create a constant with <code>5 CONSTANT five</code>, a set of
define-time actions take place; first a new word <code>five</code> is created,
then the value 5 is laid down in the body of <code>five</code> with
<code>,</code>. When <code>five</code> is executed, the address of the body is put on
the stack, and <code>@</code> retrieves the value 5. The word <code>five</code> has
no code of its own; it simply contains a data field and a pointer to the
code that follows <code>DOES&gt;</code> in its defining word. That makes words
created in this way very compact.

   <p>The final example in this section is intended to remind you that space
reserved in <code>CREATE</code>d words is <i>data</i> space and therefore can be
both read and written by a Standard program<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-3" name="fnd-3"><sup>3</sup></a>:

<pre class="example">     : foo ( "name" -- )
         CREATE -1 ,
     DOES&gt; ( -- )
         @ . ;
     
     foo first-word
     foo second-word
     
     123 ' first-word &gt;BODY !
</pre>
   <p>If <code>first-word</code> had been a <code>CREATE</code>d word, we could simply
have executed it to get the address of its data field. However, since it
was defined to have <code>DOES&gt;</code> actions, its execution semantics are to
perform those <code>DOES&gt;</code> actions. To get the address of its data field
it's necessary to use <code>'</code> to get its xt, then <code>&gt;BODY</code> to
translate the xt into the address of the data field.  When you execute
<code>first-word</code>, it will display <code>123</code>. When you execute
<code>second-word</code> it will display <code>-1</code>.

   <p><a name="index-stack-effect-of-_0040code_007bDOES_003e_007d_002dparts-1255"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bDOES_003e_007d_002dparts_002c-stack-effect-1256"></a>In the examples above the stack comment after the <code>DOES&gt;</code> specifies
the stack effect of the defined words, not the stack effect of the
following code (the following code expects the address of the body on
the top of stack, which is not reflected in the stack comment). This is
the convention that I use and recommend (it clashes a bit with using
locals declarations for stack effect specification, though).

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> Strictly speaking, the
mechanism that <code>compile,</code> uses to convert an <i>xt</i> into something
in the code area is implementation-dependent. A threaded implementation
might spit out the execution token directly whilst another
implementation might spit out a native code sequence.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-2" href="#fnd-2">2</a>]</small> It is legitimate both to read and write to
this data area.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-3" href="#fnd-3">3</a>]</small> Exercise: use this
example as a starting point for your own implementation of <code>Value</code>
and <code>TO</code> &ndash; if you get stuck, investigate the behaviour of <code>'</code> and
<code>[']</code>.</p>
