This manual is for Gforth (version 0.7.0, November 2, 2008),
a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth language.  It
serves as reference manual, but it also contains an introduction to
Forth and a Forth tutorial.

<h3 class="section">4.6 Review - elements of a Forth system</h3>

<p><a name="index-elements-of-a-Forth-system-159"></a>
To summarise this chapter:

     <ul>
<li>Forth programs use <dfn>factoring</dfn> to break a problem down into small
fragments called <dfn>words</dfn> or <dfn>definitions</dfn>. 
<li>Forth program development is an interactive process. 
<li>The main command loop that accepts input, and controls both
interpretation and compilation, is called the <dfn>text interpreter</dfn>
(also known as the <dfn>outer interpreter</dfn>). 
<li>Forth has a very simple syntax, consisting of words and numbers
separated by spaces or carriage-return characters. Any additional syntax
is imposed by <dfn>parsing words</dfn>. 
<li>Forth uses a stack to pass parameters between words. As a result, it
uses postfix notation. 
<li>To use a word that has previously been defined, the text interpreter
searches for the word in the <dfn>name dictionary</dfn>. 
<li>Words have <dfn>interpretation semantics</dfn> and <dfn>compilation semantics</dfn>. 
<li>The text interpreter uses the value of <code>state</code> to select between
the use of the <dfn>interpretation semantics</dfn> and the  <dfn>compilation
semantics</dfn> of a word that it encounters. 
<li>The relationship between the <dfn>interpretation semantics</dfn> and
<dfn>compilation semantics</dfn> for a word
depend upon the way in which the word was defined (for example, whether
it is an <dfn>immediate</dfn> word). 
<li>Forth definitions can be implemented in Forth (called <dfn>high-level
definitions</dfn>) or in some other way (usually a lower-level language and
as a result often called <dfn>low-level definitions</dfn>, <dfn>code
definitions</dfn> or <dfn>primitives</dfn>). 
<li>Many Forth systems are implemented mainly in Forth. 
</ul>
