<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bobject_002dmap_007d-discussion-2499"></a>An object is a piece of memory, like one of the data structures
described with <code>struct...end-struct</code>. It has a field
<code>object-map</code> that points to the method map for the object's
class.

   <p><a name="index-method-map-2500"></a><a name="index-virtual-function-table-2501"></a>The <em>method map</em><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a> is an array that contains the
execution tokens (<i>xt</i>s) of the methods for the object's class. Each
selector contains an offset into a method map.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bselector_007d-implementation_002c-class-2502"></a><code>selector</code> is a defining word that uses
<code>CREATE</code> and <code>DOES&gt;</code>. The body of the
selector contains the offset; the <code>DOES&gt;</code> action for a
class selector is, basically:

<pre class="example">     ( object addr ) @ over object-map @ + @ execute
</pre>
   <p>Since <code>object-map</code> is the first field of the object, it
does not generate any code. As you can see, calling a selector has a
small, constant cost.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bcurrent_002dinterface_007d-discussion-2503"></a><a name="index-class-implementation-and-representation-2504"></a>A class is basically a <code>struct</code> combined with a method
map. During the class definition the alignment and size of the class
are passed on the stack, just as with <code>struct</code>s, so
<code>field</code> can also be used for defining class
fields. However, passing more items on the stack would be
inconvenient, so <code>class</code> builds a data structure in memory,
which is accessed through the variable
<code>current-interface</code>. After its definition is complete, the
class is represented on the stack by a pointer (e.g., as parameter for
a child class definition).

   <p>A new class starts off with the alignment and size of its parent,
and a copy of the parent's method map. Defining new fields extends the
size and alignment; likewise, defining new selectors extends the
method map. <code>overrides</code> just stores a new <i>xt</i> in the method
map at the offset given by the selector.

   <p><a name="index-class-binding_002c-implementation-2505"></a>Class binding just gets the <i>xt</i> at the offset given by the selector
from the class's method map and <code>compile,</code>s (in the case of
<code>[bind]</code>) it.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bthis_007d-implementation-2506"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bcatch_007d-and-_0040code_007bthis_007d-2507"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bthis_007d-and-_0040code_007bcatch_007d-2508"></a>I implemented <code>this</code> as a <code>value</code>. At the
start of an <code>m:...;m</code> method the old <code>this</code> is
stored to the return stack and restored at the end; and the object on
the TOS is stored <code>TO this</code>. This technique has one
disadvantage: If the user does not leave the method via
<code>;m</code>, but via <code>throw</code> or <code>exit</code>,
<code>this</code> is not restored (and <code>exit</code> may
crash). To deal with the <code>throw</code> problem, I have redefined
<code>catch</code> to save and restore <code>this</code>; the same
should be done with any word that can catch an exception. As for
<code>exit</code>, I simply forbid it (as a replacement, there is
<code>exitm</code>).

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007binst_002dvar_007d-implementation-2509"></a><code>inst-var</code> is just the same as <code>field</code>, with
a different <code>DOES&gt;</code> action:
<pre class="example">     @ this +
</pre>
   <p>Similar for <code>inst-value</code>.

   <p><a name="index-class-scoping-implementation-2510"></a>Each class also has a word list that contains the words defined with
<code>inst-var</code> and <code>inst-value</code>, and its protected
words. It also has a pointer to its parent. <code>class</code> pushes
the word lists of the class and all its ancestors onto the search order stack,
and <code>end-class</code> drops them.

   <p><a name="index-interface-implementation-2511"></a>An interface is like a class without fields, parent and protected
words; i.e., it just has a method map. If a class implements an
interface, its method map contains a pointer to the method map of the
interface. The positive offsets in the map are reserved for class
methods, therefore interface map pointers have negative
offsets. Interfaces have offsets that are unique throughout the
system, unlike class selectors, whose offsets are only unique for the
classes where the selector is available (invokable).

   <p>This structure means that interface selectors have to perform one
indirection more than class selectors to find their method. Their body
contains the interface map pointer offset in the class method map, and
the method offset in the interface method map. The
<code>does&gt;</code> action for an interface selector is, basically:

<pre class="example">     ( object selector-body )
     2dup selector-interface @ ( object selector-body object interface-offset )
     swap object-map @ + @ ( object selector-body map )
     swap selector-offset @ + @ execute
</pre>
   <p>where <code>object-map</code> and <code>selector-offset</code> are
first fields and generate no code.

   <p>As a concrete example, consider the following code:

<pre class="example">     interface
       selector if1sel1
       selector if1sel2
     end-interface if1
     
     object class
       if1 implementation
       selector cl1sel1
       cell% inst-var cl1iv1
     
     ' m1 overrides construct
     ' m2 overrides if1sel1
     ' m3 overrides if1sel2
     ' m4 overrides cl1sel2
     end-class cl1
     
     create obj1 object dict-new drop
     create obj2 cl1    dict-new drop
</pre>
   <p>The data structure created by this code (including the data structure
for <code>object</code>) is shown in the
<a href="objects-implementation.eps">figure</a>, assuming a cell size of 4.
