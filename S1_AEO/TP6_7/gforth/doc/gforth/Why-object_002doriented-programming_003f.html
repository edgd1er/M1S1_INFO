This manual is for Gforth (version 0.7.0, November 2, 2008),
a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth language.  It
serves as reference manual, but it also contains an introduction to
Forth and a Forth tutorial.

<h4 class="subsection">5.23.1 Why object-oriented programming?</h4>

<p><a name="index-object_002doriented-programming-motivation-2418"></a><a name="index-motivation-for-object_002doriented-programming-2419"></a>
Often we have to deal with several data structures (<em>objects</em>),
that have to be treated similarly in some respects, but differently in
others. Graphical objects are the textbook example: circles, triangles,
dinosaurs, icons, and others, and we may want to add more during program
development. We want to apply some operations to any graphical object,
e.g., <code>draw</code> for displaying it on the screen. However, <code>draw</code>
has to do something different for every kind of object. 
<!-- TODO add some other operations eg perimeter, area -->
<!-- and tie in to concrete examples later.. -->

   <p>We could implement <code>draw</code> as a big <code>CASE</code>
control structure that executes the appropriate code depending on the
kind of object to be drawn. This would be not be very elegant, and,
moreover, we would have to change <code>draw</code> every time we add
a new kind of graphical object (say, a spaceship).

   <p>What we would rather do is: When defining spaceships, we would tell
the system: &ldquo;Here's how you <code>draw</code> a spaceship; you figure
out the rest&rdquo;.

   <p>This is the problem that all systems solve that (rightfully) call
themselves object-oriented; the object-oriented packages presented here
solve this problem (and not much else). 
<!-- TODO ?list properties of oo systems.. oo vs o-based? -->
