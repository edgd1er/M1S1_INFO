<h5 class="subsubsection">5.9.8.3 Advanced does&gt; usage example</h5>

<p>The MIPS disassembler (<samp><span class="file">arch/mips/disasm.fs</span></samp>) contains many words
for disassembling instructions, that follow a very repetetive scheme:

<pre class="example">     :noname <var>disasm-operands</var> s" <var>inst-name</var>" type ;
     <var>entry-num</var> cells <var>table</var> + !
</pre>
   <p>Of course, this inspires the idea to factor out the commonalities to
allow a definition like

<pre class="example">     <var>disasm-operands</var> <var>entry-num</var> <var>table</var> define-inst <var>inst-name</var>
</pre>
   <p>The parameters <var>disasm-operands</var> and <var>table</var> are usually
correlated.  Moreover, before I wrote the disassembler, there already
existed code that defines instructions like this:

<pre class="example">     <var>entry-num</var> <var>inst-format</var> <var>inst-name</var>
</pre>
   <p>This code comes from the assembler and resides in
<samp><span class="file">arch/mips/insts.fs</span></samp>.

   <p>So I had to define the <var>inst-format</var> words that performed the scheme
above when executed.  At first I chose to use run-time code-generation:

<pre class="example">     : <var>inst-format</var> ( entry-num "name" -- ; compiled code: addr w -- )
       :noname Postpone <var>disasm-operands</var>
       name Postpone sliteral Postpone type Postpone ;
       swap cells <var>table</var> + ! ;
</pre>
   <p>Note that this supplies the other two parameters of the scheme above.

   <p>An alternative would have been to write this using
<code>create</code>/<code>does&gt;</code>:

<pre class="example">     : <var>inst-format</var> ( entry-num "name" -- )
       here name string, ( entry-num c-addr ) \ parse and save "name"
       noname create , ( entry-num )
       latestxt swap cells <var>table</var> + !
     does&gt; ( addr w -- )
       \ disassemble instruction w at addr
       @ &gt;r
       <var>disasm-operands</var>
       r&gt; count type ;
</pre>
   <p>Somehow the first solution is simpler, mainly because it's simpler to
shift a string from definition-time to use-time with <code>sliteral</code>
than with <code>string,</code> and friends.

   <p>I wrote a lot of words following this scheme and soon thought about
factoring out the commonalities among them.  Note that this uses a
two-level defining word, i.e., a word that defines ordinary defining
words.

   <p>This time a solution involving <code>postpone</code> and friends seemed more
difficult (try it as an exercise), so I decided to use a
<code>create</code>/<code>does&gt;</code> word; since I was already at it, I also used
<code>create</code>/<code>does&gt;</code> for the lower level (try using
<code>postpone</code> etc. as an exercise), resulting in the following
definition:

<pre class="example">     : define-format ( disasm-xt table-xt -- )
         \ define an instruction format that uses disasm-xt for
         \ disassembling and enters the defined instructions into table
         \ table-xt
         create 2,
     does&gt; ( u "inst" -- )
         \ defines an anonymous word for disassembling instruction inst,
         \ and enters it as u-th entry into table-xt
         2@ swap here name string, ( u table-xt disasm-xt c-addr ) \ remember string
         noname create 2,      \ define anonymous word
         execute latestxt swap ! \ enter xt of defined word into table-xt
     does&gt; ( addr w -- )
         \ disassemble instruction w at addr
         2@ &gt;r ( addr w disasm-xt R: c-addr )
         execute ( R: c-addr ) \ disassemble operands
         r&gt; count type ; \ print name
</pre>
   <p>Note that the tables here (in contrast to above) do the <code>cells +</code>
by themselves (that's why you have to pass an xt).  This word is used in
the following way:

<pre class="example">     ' <var>disasm-operands</var> ' <var>table</var> define-format <var>inst-format</var>
</pre>
   <p>As shown above, the defined instruction format is then used like this:

<pre class="example">     <var>entry-num</var> <var>inst-format</var> <var>inst-name</var>
</pre>
   <p>In terms of currying, this kind of two-level defining word provides the
parameters in three stages: first <var>disasm-operands</var> and <var>table</var>,
then <var>entry-num</var> and <var>inst-name</var>, finally <code>addr w</code>, i.e.,
the instruction to be disassembled.

   <p>Of course this did not quite fit all the instruction format names used
in <samp><span class="file">insts.fs</span></samp>, so I had to define a few wrappers that conditioned
the parameters into the right form.

   <p>If you have trouble following this section, don't worry.  First, this is
involved and takes time (and probably some playing around) to
understand; second, this is the first two-level
<code>create</code>/<code>does&gt;</code> word I have written in seventeen years of
Forth; and if I did not have <samp><span class="file">insts.fs</span></samp> to start with, I may well
have elected to use just a one-level defining word (with some repeating
of parameters when using the defining word). So it is not necessary to
understand this, but it may improve your understanding of Forth.
