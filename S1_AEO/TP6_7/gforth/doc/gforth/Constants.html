This manual is for Gforth (version 0.7.0, November 2, 2008),
a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth language.  It
serves as reference manual, but it also contains an introduction to
Forth and a Forth tutorial.

<h4 class="subsection">5.9.3 Constants</h4>

<p><a name="index-constants-1210"></a>
<code>Constant</code> allows you to declare a fixed value and refer to it by
name. For example:

<pre class="example">     12 Constant INCHES-PER-FOOT
     3E+08 fconstant SPEED-O-LIGHT
</pre>
   <p>A <code>Variable</code> can be both read and written, so its run-time
behaviour is to supply an address through which its current value can be
manipulated. In contrast, the value of a <code>Constant</code> cannot be
changed once it has been declared<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a> so it's not necessary to supply the address &ndash; it is more
efficient to return the value of the constant directly. That's exactly
what happens; the run-time effect of a constant is to put its value on
the top of the stack (You can find one
way of implementing <code>Constant</code> in <a href="User_002ddefined-Defining-Words.html#User_002ddefined-Defining-Words">User-defined Defining Words</a>).

   <p>Forth also provides <code>2Constant</code> and <code>fconstant</code> for defining
double and floating-point constants, respectively.

<!-- anton: In what way? -->
<p>Constants in Forth behave differently from their equivalents in other
programming languages. In other languages, a constant (such as an EQU in
assembler or a #define in C) only exists at compile-time; in the
executable program the constant has been translated into an absolute
number and, unless you are using a symbolic debugger, it's impossible to
know what abstract thing that number represents. In Forth a constant has
an entry in the header space and remains there after the code that uses
it has been defined. In fact, it must remain in the dictionary since it
has run-time duties to perform. For example:

<pre class="example">     12 Constant INCHES-PER-FOOT
     : FEET-TO-INCHES ( n1 -- n2 ) INCHES-PER-FOOT * ;
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-in_002dlining-of-constants-1220"></a>When <code>FEET-TO-INCHES</code> is executed, it will in turn execute the xt
associated with the constant <code>INCHES-PER-FOOT</code>. If you use
<code>see</code> to decompile the definition of <code>FEET-TO-INCHES</code>, you can
see that it makes a call to <code>INCHES-PER-FOOT</code>. Some Forth compilers
attempt to optimise constants by in-lining them where they are used. You
can force Gforth to in-line a constant like this:

<pre class="example">     : FEET-TO-INCHES ( n1 -- n2 ) [ INCHES-PER-FOOT ] LITERAL * ;
</pre>
   <p>If you use <code>see</code> to decompile <i>this</i> version of
<code>FEET-TO-INCHES</code>, you can see that <code>INCHES-PER-FOOT</code> is no
longer present. To understand how this works, read
<a href="Interpret_002fCompile-states.html#Interpret_002fCompile-states">Interpret/Compile states</a>, and <a href="Literals.html#Literals">Literals</a>.

   <p>In-lining constants in this way might improve execution time
fractionally, and can ensure that a constant is now only referenced at
compile-time. However, the definition of the constant still remains in
the dictionary. Some Forth compilers provide a mechanism for controlling
a second dictionary for holding transient words such that this second
dictionary can be deleted later in order to recover memory
space. However, there is no standard way of doing this.

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> Well, often it can be &ndash; but
not in a Standard, portable way. It's safer to use a <code>Value</code> (read
on).</p>
