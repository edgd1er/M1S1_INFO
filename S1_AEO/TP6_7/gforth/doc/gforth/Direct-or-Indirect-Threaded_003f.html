This manual is for Gforth (version 0.7.0, November 2, 2008),
a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth language.  It
serves as reference manual, but it also contains an introduction to
Forth and a Forth tutorial.

<h4 class="subsection">14.2.2 Direct or Indirect Threaded?</h4>

<p><a name="index-threading_002c-direct-or-indirect_003f-3469"></a>
Threaded forth code consists of references to primitives (simple machine
code routines like <code>+</code>) and to non-primitives (e.g., colon
definitions, variables, constants); for a specific class of
non-primitives (e.g., variables) there is one code routine (e.g.,
<code>dovar</code>), but each variable needs a separate reference to its data.

   <p>Traditionally Forth has been implemented as indirect threaded code,
because this allows to use only one cell to reference a non-primitive
(basically you point to the data, and find the code address there).

   <p><a name="index-primitive_002dcentric-threaded-code-3470"></a>However, threaded code in Gforth (since 0.6.0) uses two cells for
non-primitives, one for the code address, and one for the data address;
the data pointer is an immediate argument for the virtual machine
instruction represented by the code address.  We call this
<em>primitive-centric</em> threaded code, because all code addresses point
to simple primitives.  E.g., for a variable, the code address is for
<code>lit</code> (also used for integer literals like <code>99</code>).

   <p>Primitive-centric threaded code allows us to use (faster) direct
threading as dispatch method, completely portably (direct threaded code
in Gforth before 0.6.0 required architecture-specific code).  It also
eliminates the performance problems related to I-cache consistency that
386 implementations have with direct threaded code, and allows
additional optimizations.

   <p><a name="index-hybrid-direct_002findirect-threaded-code-3471"></a>There is a catch, however: the <var>xt</var> parameter of <code>execute</code> can
occupy only one cell, so how do we pass non-primitives with their code
<em>and</em> data addresses to them?  Our answer is to use indirect
threaded dispatch for <code>execute</code> and other words that use a
single-cell xt.  So, normal threaded code in colon definitions uses
direct threading, and <code>execute</code> and similar words, which dispatch
to xts on the data stack, use indirect threaded code.  We call this
<em>hybrid direct/indirect</em> threaded code.

   <p><a name="index-engines_002c-gforth-vs_002e-gforth_002dfast-vs_002e-gforth_002ditc-3472"></a><a name="index-gforth-engine-3473"></a><a name="index-gforth_002dfast-engine-3474"></a>The engines <samp><span class="command">gforth</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">gforth-fast</span></samp> use hybrid
direct/indirect threaded code.  This means that with these engines you
cannot use <code>,</code> to compile an xt.  Instead, you have to use
<code>compile,</code>.

   <p><a name="index-gforth_002ditc-engine-3475"></a>If you want to compile xts with <code>,</code>, use <samp><span class="command">gforth-itc</span></samp>. 
This engine uses plain old indirect threaded code.  It still compiles in
a primitive-centric style, so you cannot use <code>compile,</code> instead of
<code>,</code> (e.g., for producing tables of xts with <code>] word1 word2
... [</code>).  If you want to do that, you have to use <samp><span class="command">gforth-itc</span></samp>
and execute <code>' , is compile,</code>.  Your program can check if it is
running on a hybrid direct/indirect threaded engine or a pure indirect
threaded engine with <code>threading-method</code> (see <a href="Threading-Words.html#Threading-Words">Threading Words</a>).
