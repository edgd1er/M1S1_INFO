a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth language.  It
serves as reference manual, but it also contains an introduction to
Forth and a Forth tutorial.

<h4 class="subsection">14.3.2 TOS Optimization</h4>

<p><a name="index-TOS-optimization-for-primitives-3491"></a><a name="index-primitives_002c-keeping-the-TOS-in-a-register-3492"></a>
An important optimization for stack machine emulators, e.g., Forth
engines, is keeping  one or more of the top stack items in
registers.  If a word has the stack effect <i>in1</i>...<i>inx</i> <code>--</code>
<i>out1</i>...<i>outy</i>, keeping the top <i>n</i> items in registers
     <ul>
<li>is better than keeping <i>n-1</i> items, if <i>x&gt;=n</i> and <i>y&gt;=n</i>,
due to fewer loads from and stores to the stack. 
<li>is slower than keeping <i>n-1</i> items, if <i>x&lt;&gt;y</i> and <i>x&lt;n</i> and
<i>y&lt;n</i>, due to additional moves between registers. 
</ul>

   <p><a name="index-g_t_002dDUSE_005fTOS-3493"></a><a name="index-g_t_002dDUSE_005fNO_005fTOS-3494"></a>In particular, keeping one item in a register is never a disadvantage,
if there are enough registers. Keeping two items in registers is a
disadvantage for frequent words like <code>?branch</code>, constants,
variables, literals and <code>i</code>. Therefore our generator only produces
code that keeps zero or one items in registers. The generated C code
covers both cases; the selection between these alternatives is made at
C-compile time using the switch <code>-DUSE_TOS</code>. <code>TOS</code> in the C
code for <code>+</code> is just a simple variable name in the one-item case,
otherwise it is a macro that expands into <code>sp[0]</code>. Note that the
GNU C compiler tries to keep simple variables like <code>TOS</code> in
registers, and it usually succeeds, if there are enough registers.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_002dDUSE_005fFTOS-3495"></a><a name="index-g_t_002dDUSE_005fNO_005fFTOS-3496"></a>The primitive generator performs the TOS optimization for the
floating-point stack, too (<code>-DUSE_FTOS</code>). For floating-point
operations the benefit of this optimization is even larger:
floating-point operations take quite long on most processors, but can be
performed in parallel with other operations as long as their results are
not used. If the FP-TOS is kept in a register, this works. If
it is kept on the stack, i.e., in memory, the store into memory has to
wait for the result of the floating-point operation, lengthening the
execution time of the primitive considerably.

   <p>The TOS optimization makes the automatic generation of primitives a
bit more complicated. Just replacing all occurrences of <code>sp[0]</code> by
<code>TOS</code> is not sufficient. There are some special cases to
consider:
     <ul>
<li>In the case of <code>dup ( w -- w w )</code> the generator must not
eliminate the store to the original location of the item on the stack,
if the TOS optimization is turned on. 
<li>Primitives with stack effects of the form <code>--</code>
<i>out1</i>...<i>outy</i> must store the TOS to the stack at the start. 
Likewise, primitives with the stack effect <i>in1</i>...<i>inx</i> <code>--</code>
must load the TOS from the stack at the end. But for the null stack
effect <code>--</code> no stores or loads should be generated. 
</ul>
