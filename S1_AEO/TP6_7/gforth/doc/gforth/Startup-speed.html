This manual is for Gforth (version 0.7.0, November 2, 2008),
a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth language.  It
serves as reference manual, but it also contains an introduction to
Forth and a Forth tutorial.

<h3 class="section">2.7 Startup speed</h3>

<p><a name="index-Startup-speed-72"></a><a name="index-speed_002c-startup-73"></a>
If Gforth is used for CGI scripts or in shell scripts, its startup
speed may become a problem.  On a 300MHz 21064a under Linux-2.2.13 with
glibc-2.0.7, <code>gforth -e bye</code> takes about 24.6ms user and 11.3ms
system time.

   <p>If startup speed is a problem, you may consider the following ways to
improve it; or you may consider ways to reduce the number of startups
(for example, by using Fast-CGI).

   <p>An easy step that influences Gforth startup speed is the use of the
<samp><span class="option">--no-dynamic</span></samp> option; this decreases image loading speed, but
increases compile-time and run-time.

   <p>Another step to improve startup speed is to statically link Gforth, by
building it with <code>XLDFLAGS=-static</code>.  This requires more memory for
the code and will therefore slow down the first invocation, but
subsequent invocations avoid the dynamic linking overhead.  Another
disadvantage is that Gforth won't profit from library upgrades.  As a
result, <code>gforth-static -e bye</code> takes about 17.1ms user and
8.2ms system time.

   <p>The next step to improve startup speed is to use a non-relocatable image
(see <a href="Non_002dRelocatable-Image-Files.html#Non_002dRelocatable-Image-Files">Non-Relocatable Image Files</a>).  You can create this image with
<code>gforth -e "savesystem gforthnr.fi bye"</code> and later use it with
<code>gforth -i gforthnr.fi ...</code>.  This avoids the relocation overhead
and a part of the copy-on-write overhead.  The disadvantage is that the
non-relocatable image does not work if the OS gives Gforth a different
address for the dictionary, for whatever reason; so you better provide a
fallback on a relocatable image.  <code>gforth-static -i gforthnr.fi -e
bye</code> takes about 15.3ms user and 7.5ms system time.

   <p>The final step is to disable dictionary hashing in Gforth.  Gforth
builds the hash table on startup, which takes much of the startup
overhead. You can do this by commenting out the <code>include hash.fs</code>
in <samp><span class="file">startup.fs</span></samp> and everything that requires <samp><span class="file">hash.fs</span></samp> (at the
moment <samp><span class="file">table.fs</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">ekey.fs</span></samp>) and then doing <code>make</code>. 
The disadvantages are that functionality like <code>table</code> and
<code>ekey</code> is missing and that text interpretation (e.g., compiling)
now takes much longer. So, you should only use this method if there is
no significant text interpretation to perform (the script should be
compiled into the image, amongst other things).  <code>gforth-static -i
gforthnrnh.fi -e bye</code> takes about 2.1ms user and 6.1ms system time.
