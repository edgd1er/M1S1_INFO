This manual is for Gforth (version 0.7.0, November 2, 2008),
a fast and portable implementation of the ANS Forth language.  It
serves as reference manual, but it also contains an introduction to
Forth and a Forth tutorial.

<h3 class="section">4.5 Forth is written in Forth</h3>

<p><a name="index-structure-of-Forth-programs-158"></a>
When you start up a Forth compiler, a large number of definitions
already exist. In Forth, you develop a new application using bottom-up
programming techniques to create new definitions that are defined in
terms of existing definitions. As you create each definition you can
test and debug it interactively.

   <p>If you have tried out the examples in this section, you will probably
have typed them in by hand; when you leave Gforth, your definitions will
be lost. You can avoid this by using a text editor to enter Forth source
code into a file, and then loading code from the file using
<code>include</code> (see <a href="Forth-source-files.html#Forth-source-files">Forth source files</a>). A Forth source file is
processed by the text interpreter, just as though you had typed it in by
hand<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.

   <p>Gforth also supports the traditional Forth alternative to using text
files for program entry (see <a href="Blocks.html#Blocks">Blocks</a>).

   <p>In common with many, if not most, Forth compilers, most of Gforth is
actually written in Forth. All of the <samp><span class="file">.fs</span></samp> files in the
installation directory<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a> are Forth source files, which you can
study to see examples of Forth programming.

   <p>Gforth maintains a history file that records every line that you type to
the text interpreter. This file is preserved between sessions, and is
used to provide a command-line recall facility. If you enter long
definitions by hand, you can use a text editor to paste them out of the
history file into a Forth source file for reuse at a later time
(for more information see <a href="Command_002dline-editing.html#Command_002dline-editing">Command-line editing</a>).
